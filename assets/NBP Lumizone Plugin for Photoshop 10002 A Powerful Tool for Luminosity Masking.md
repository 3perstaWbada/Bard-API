However, creating and modifying luminosity masks in Photoshop can be a tedious and time-consuming process. You may have to use actions, channels, or other methods that create extra layers or clutter your workspace. You may also have to switch back and forth between different panels and menus to fine-tune your masks.
 
That's why NBP Lumizone Plug-in for Photoshop 1.0.002 is a game-changer. It is a plugin that simplifies and streamlines the process of luminosity masking in Photoshop. It allows you to create and control luminosity masks for any layer or adjustment layer with just a few clicks. You can also preview and adjust your masks on the fly, without leaving the plugin panel.
 
## How Does NBP Lumizone Plug-in Work?
 
NBP Lumizone Plug-in for Photoshop 1.0.002 works by creating a mask for any layer or adjustment layer based on one of three options: the overall luminance of the image, the R, G, or B channels of the image, or the overall saturation map of the image. You can then select any combination of 11 luminance ranges for your mask, from pure black to pure white, and invert them if needed.
 
You can also toggle the layer or mask view on and off while adjusting your luminance ranges, so you can see how your mask affects your image in real time. You can also adjust the contrast of your mask as needed, to make it more or less refined.
 
One of the best features of NBP Lumizone Plug-in is that it does not create any additional layers or channels to create or modify your masks. This means that your file size will not increase unnecessarily, and your workspace will remain clean and organized.
 
NBP Lumizone Plug-in also comes with six presets of commonly used luminosity masks, such as highlights, midtones, shadows, etc., that you can apply with one click. You can also save your own custom preset for future use.
